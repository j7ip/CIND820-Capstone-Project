Dataset file and description also saved in folder [Data](https://github.com/j7ip/CIND820CapstoneProject/tree/main/Data)




**2. Description of the project**
The theme of this capstone project is forecasting the popularity of online news prior to publication based on a broad set of extracted features.

3 questions that are focused on:
1. the relationship between the popularity and the features of article
2. the best model for predicting the popularity of online news
3. selecting the set of features to optimize the performance of the model


**3. Program language used in the project**
Python

**4. Approach:**
Classficiation approach - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
